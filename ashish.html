Content
How is eTG complete different from other resources I use?
Therapeutic Guidelines Ltd (TGL) prides itself on publishing independent, expert, unbiased and evidence-based information you can trust. Our publications are intended specifically to meet the needs of busy health professionals who want reliable, practical and user-friendly therapeutic information at the point of care.

Independence is an essential feature of this organisation-TGL is completely self-funded with all of its revenue from subscriptions and book sales. No grants. No advertising. No shareholders. No sponsors. To protect and maintain our independence, TGL has a strict policy on conflict of interest which you can access here.

How are Therapeutic Guidelines Ltd products produced?
A detailed description of our production process can be found here. If you have any further questions regarding production, contact us at admin@tg.org.au.

Are the contents of the books and eTG complete the same?
eTG complete includes all the topics from all books in the Therapeutic Guidelines series, as well as other topics not available in books, such as the Fatigue Guidelines. Patient information sheets, references, links and calculators contained in eTG complete are not included in the books.

The digital version is updated in between scheduled revisions where appropriate so, on occasion, a digital topic may differ from the book version.

When are the new versions of Therapeutic Guidelines titles published and how often are they updated?
Electronic releases are published three times a year, coinciding with the release of a book title. Books are updated every 3 to 4 years. Under some circumstances, topics are updated ahead of schedule.

Current titles, versions and dates of publication are:
Analgesic version 6, 2012
Antibiotic version 15, 2014
Cardiovascular version 7, 2018
Dermatology version 4, 2015
Diabetes version 1, 2019
Gastrointestinal version 6, 2016
Neurology version 5, 2017
Oral and Dental version 2, 2012
Palliative Care version 4, 2016

Respiratory version 5, 2015

eTG complete publication date
The publication date of eTG complete is January 2019.

How do I use the doses in eTG complete?
The dosing regimens in the text generally apply to nonpregnant adults of average size; higher or lower doses are appropriate for some patients. Children's doses have not been assessed for suitability in neonates; when doses are given for neonates, they apply to full-term neonates only, unless otherwise specified.

Why is there sometimes a number shown on the left of a drug regimen in eTG complete?
Where more than one drug regimen is listed for an indication, the number next to the regimen shows its place in therapy (eg 1 for first-line therapy, 2 for second-line therapy). Drugs that are equally appropriate for a given indication are marked with the same number.

Why are some drugs in eTG not listed in the drop-down list in the drug index?
The drug index currently only lists drugs that are part of a full dose recommendation (shown in a blue panel in eTG complete), but work is underway to include drugs and doses given in the general text and in tables. In the mean time, if your drug does not appear in the drop-down list, try searching using the main search box (or magnifying glass).

I have some suggestions that I would like to pass on to the editor, what should I do?
If you are using eTG complete online, feedback can be sent directly to Therapeutic Guidelines by clicking on the 'Envelope' icon at the top of the topic or section that you wish to comment on. If you are a book user, send an email to: feedback@tg.org.au. All comments will be logged and you will receive a response if requested.
